Description: TISC landscape evolution modeling is a powerful open source tool for 4D analysis of flexure and surficial process. However, a weakness of TISC is the ability to readily compare cross-model results in a qualitative way. TISCViewR was created to accept both input and output files from TISC to perform a more comparable analysis of model runs. TISCViewR was built to focus on basin depth, length, symmetry, and geohistory. Operations are performed upon data preserved in TISC's pfl file's- cross sectional data. Therefore, TISCViewR reduces dimensions to 3D. This research was supported by the National Science Foundation (EAR‐1824557).
